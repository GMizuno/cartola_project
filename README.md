First of all this project is used to improve my skills in Data Engineering and Python. This project try to extract data

In the future I will expand this lakehouse to other tournament, the first one will Premier League (UK), the second La
Liga (Spain) and last one Bundesliga (Germany). After all, I will collect information from previous years.
