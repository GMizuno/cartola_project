# cartola_project

First of all this project is used to improve my skills in Data Engineering and Python. In this project, I try to extract data
from API, create Data Lake and analyse this data in BI tool like [Preset](https://preset.io). 
Esse pacote consiste em resolver a primeira parte desse projeto, ou seja extrair dados da API, criando a infraestrutura necesaria para armazenar esses dados em algum storage.

In the beginning I will collect information about first division of brazilian national league at the year of 2022.
In the future I will expand this lakehouse to other tournament, the first one will Premier League (UK), the second La
Liga (Spain) and last one Bundesliga (Germany). After all, I will collect information from previous years.
